# Image Classification with Deep Learning

An image classification project using a CNN model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This project demonstrates deep learning techniques and deploys a Flask-based API for predicting image categories.

## Features
- Train a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Classify images into 10 categories from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Deploy a REST API for predictions.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
